## Create your own

The scripts are written in JavaScript. You can easily create your own based on
these examples. Photoshop also comes with many build-in scripts which you can
look at to give more ideas of what is possible. If you are interested in
scripting in more detail you can also take a look at the blog article which
shows an example of how to
